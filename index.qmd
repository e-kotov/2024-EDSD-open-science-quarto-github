This website provides supporting materials for the workshop **Open Science and Reproducibility with Quarto, GitHub, and R** which is part of the [European Doctoral School of Demography (EDSD)](https://www.eaps.nl/edsd/About-EDSD){target="_blank"} 2024 preparatory courses hosted by the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://demogr.mpg.de/){target="_blank"} (Rostock, Germany).

## Expected learning outcomes

- Able to use Quarto to create `html` documents with plain and markdown-formatted text and `R` code.

- Able to upload a project with reproducible analysis to GitHub.


### Prerequisites
Students must have basic `R` training, including knowledge of the `tidyverse` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for data visualization, as well as familiarity with `RStudio` (as provided in the [**EDSD 140 Computer Programming for Demographers**](https://github.com/christiandudel/EDSD2024){target="_blank"} course). To participate in the workshop, we recommend that you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} account and have `R`, `RStudio`, and `git` installed. You can follow the setup instructions [here](00-setup.qmd).

1. How to create a GitHub account: [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
2. Brief intro to Quarto: [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html)
3. Quarto documentation: [https://quarto.org/docs/reference/](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/)


`Quarto` is *"an open-source scientific and technical publishing system"* [^1] that allows you to generate reproducible reports, websites, presentations and much more, by mixing plain text, simple [markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html){target="_blank"} text formatting, and code. And not just `R` code, but also `Python` and `Julia`. The output format can be `html`, `pdf`, but also `docx` (if you really need it). You can also use addons/extensions to convert simple documents written in `Quarto` to publication ready `pdf`s using relevant [templates](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html){target="_blank"}.
